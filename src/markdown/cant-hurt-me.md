# Can't Hurt Me Book Review

I have just finished *Can't Hurt Me* by David Goggins and wow. 

I've been a follower of Goggins for a few years now. So much so that I have pretty much consumed almost all of the available podcasts featuring him, and listened to the podcast between him and Joe Rogan at least a dozen times over (both the Joe Rogan Experience #1080 and #1212). But, surprisingly, I never got around to finishing his book. Since I had already watched or listened to a lot of Goggins, I wasn't necessarily expecting to get a lot of new material or lessons from the read, but I was wrong.

I first started the book on my Kindle, then moved to the audiobook because I heard about the extra podcast aspect he added to the book in and between chapters. The talks that he had with the narrator, Adam Skolnick, gave a lot of great context to each scene and made each event feel that much more real and captivating. It's truly inspiring thinking about how he's able to talk about his shortcomings in such fine detail without feeling embarrassed or the need to abide by other people's expectations. Instead of hiding his insecurities, he has openly shared them and morphed them into fuel to power his achievements even further.

One of the things that struck me the most was his detail-oriented mindset during the latter half of the book. Before races or tests, he would use all of his time to learn as much as he could about the task at hand, even if it only gave him a very slight edge. Whether that be studying previous winners of the race or looking into the minutest of details to give him an advantage on the pull-up bar during his world record attempts. That obsession is something we can all apply to our lives by taking control of our mission down to every particular part of a part. 

Another thing that's special about this book is that you know you aren't getting bullshitted. When reading self-help books, there's always an untrustworthy feeling when you read their words because you sometimes think, "You're saying all this, but what have you done?" Sure, many of them have started businesses and likely make a great living, but you can never truly know the type of person they are behind the pen or computer. David Goggins, on the other hand, is different. Even if you don't believe that he's always this mentally tough 24/7, you can't deny his achievements from both his military days and his ultra days, which give him undeniable credibility.

Since this book is so forward and direct, it actively punches you in the face and immediately points out your insecurities. If there is a particular part of the book that stings or a part that makes you at least mildly uncomfortable, it's a sign that it's a part of your life that needs development.

I can't say that there aren't any flaws with the book. I could definitely see if some people are turned off by the sometimes seemingly unnecessary cursing or provocative language. But I'd argue that's what keeps it real and authentic. He doesn't try to write it beautifully or eloquently, but just gives it to you raw and unfiltered, which adds to the book in my opinion.

The book is not for everybody, but if you do read it with an open mind, I'm sure you will get at least one lesson out of it.

[4.5/5]
